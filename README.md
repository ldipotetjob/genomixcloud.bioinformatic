## Genomix Cloud open source tools repository    

**This repository is still under construction and contains the source code of our plain images**. You will find here how to build the docker images involved in our different workflows. At the same time, we include some clues about how to improve the performance and automation of the AWS ecosystem. The Genomixcloud's platform can be found at https://genomixcloud.com/
